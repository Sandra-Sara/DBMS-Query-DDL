 SQL allows subqueries to occur wherever an expression returning 
a value is permitted, provided the subquery returns only one tuple 
containing a single attribute; such subqueries are called scalar 
subqueries.

Lists all departments along with the number of instructors in each department.
Example 1:
select dept_name, 
             ( select count(*) 
             from instructor 
             where department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name)
 as num_instructors
 from department;

Example 2:
 select name
 from instructor
 where  salary * 10 > 
             ( select budget  from department 
               where department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name)
