 A delete command operates on only one relation. If we want to 
 delete tuples from several relations, we must use one delete 
 command for each relation.


   Example 1:Delete all instructor
   delete 
   from instructor;

  Example 2: Delete all instructors from the Finance department
  delete from instructor
  where dept_name= ’Finance’;

  Example 3:Delete all tuples in the instructor relation for those instructors associated with a department located in the Watson building.
     delete from instructor
            where dept_name in (select dept_name
                                from department
                                where building = ’Watson’);
  Example 4: Delete all instructors with a salary between $13,000 and $15,000.
     delete 
     from instructor
     where salary between 13000 and 15000;

 Example 5: Delete all instructors whose salary is less than the average salary of instructors.

    delete from instructor
    where salary< (select avg (salary) from instructor);
